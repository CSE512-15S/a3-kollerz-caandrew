## Project Name: Senatorial Stances on Hillary for President


Our data domain consists of information about current U.S. Senators including their endorsement for Hillary Clinton, their re-election year, party affilliation as well as some personal information like education history and birthdate. The key element we plan to focus on is the relationship of various senators to Hillary Clinton. 

The foundation of our visualization will be a network map that illustrates senatorial support for Hillary Clinton for President. It will serve as an tool that allows users to explore senatorial relationships to Hillary and information about individual senators. 

Our motivating questions are: 

What are the effects of party affiliation on senatorial endorsement?
What are the effects of gender?
Does whether or not senators served on the senate while Bill Clinton was president have an effect?
Who is up for re-election during the next Presidental term?
Who are these senators? What can we learn about them?

By implementing a series of filters, we will allow our users to explore these questions with ease.

## Running Instructions

Put your running instructions here. (Tell us how to run your visualization.) 

If your visualization is web-based,  it would be great if your submission can be opened online. [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) is a good and easy way to put your visualization online so you can put your linfile:///Users/cynthiaandrews/Documents/School/sp15/data_viz/a_3/a3-kollerz-caandrew/index.htmlk here.  For example:

Access our visualization at http://cse512-15s.github.io/a3-jheer-domoritz-jasnyder/ or download this repository and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` and access this from http://localhost:9000/.

If you put your work online, please also write a [one-line description and add a link to your final work](http://note.io/1n3u46s) so people can access it directly from the CSE512-15S page.

## Story Board

Put either your storyboard content or a [link to your storyboard pdf file](storyboard.pdf?raw=true) here. Just like A2, you can use any software to create a *reasonable* pdf storyboard.


### Changes between Storyboard and the Final Implementation

Our initial storyboard lacked a productive way to show senators who had no known endorsment for Hillary. In our final implementation, we
decided to separate this sub-group from the main network map. We also added a reverse lookup by state of representaion.â€™


## Development Process

Include:
- Breakdown of how the work was split among the group members. 
- A commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: 
  - Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application?
  - What aspects took the most time?
