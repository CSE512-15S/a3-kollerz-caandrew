## Project Name: Senatorial Stances on Hillary for President

Our domanin consists of information about current U.S. Senators including whether or not they have endorsed Hillary Clinton for President,re-election year, party affilliation as well as some personal information like education history and birthdate. 

The foundation of our visualization will be a network map that illustrates infomation about senators who have Hillary Clinton for President. It will serve as a tool that allows users to explore senatorial relationships to the Hillary Clinton campaign and information about individual senators. 

Our motivating questions are: 

What are the effects of party affiliation on senatorial endorsement? Gender?
Does whether or not senators served on the senate during the Clinton administration have an effect?
Who is up for re-election during the next Presidentail term?
Who are these senators? What can we learn about them?

By implementing a series of filters, we will allow our users to explore these questions with ease.

## Running Instructions

Access our visualization <a href = "http://cse512-15s.github.io/a3-kollerz-caandrew"> here/a>

## Story Board

Put either your storyboard content or a [link to your storyboard pdf file](storyboard.pdf?raw=true) here. Just like A2, you can use any software to create a *reasonable* pdf storyboard.


### Changes between Storyboard and the Final Implementation

Our initial storyboard lacked a productive way to show senators who had no known endorsment for Hillary. In our final implementation, we
decided to separate this sub-group from the main network map. We also added a reverse lookup by state of representaion.


## Development Process

Include:
- Breakdown of how the work was split among the group members. 
- A commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: 
  - Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application?
  - What aspects took the most time?
