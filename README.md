## Project Name: Senatorial Stances on Hillary for President

Our domain consists of information about current U.S. Senators including whether or not they have endorsed Hillary Clinton for President, re-election year, party affilliation as well as some personal information like education history and birthdate. 

The foundation of our visualization will be a network map that illustrates infomation about senators who have Hillary Clinton for President. It will serve as a tool that allows users to explore senatorial relationships to the Hillary Clinton campaign and information about individual senators. 

Our motivating questions are: 

* What are the effects of party affiliation on senatorial endorsement?
* What are the effects of gender?
* Does whether or not senators served on the senate while Bill Clinton was  president have an effect?
* Who is up for re-election during the next Presidental term?
* Who are these senators? What can we learn about them?

By implementing a series of filters, we will allow our users to explore these questions with ease.

## Running Instructions

Access our visualization [here](http://cse512-15s.github.io/a3-kollerz-caandrew).

## Story Board

You can access our development storyboard [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hcvH2zJa1xbvtXZYlpFX8fuzdI9x3R9LGkssbgKAcZk/edit?usp=sharing).


### Changes between Storyboard and the Final Implementation

1.  We decided to encode senators using color, choosing red/blue for democrats/republicans since those colors are culturally accepted as representing their corresponding party affiliation. 
2.  We expanded our data to include senators who had no known endorsement for Hillary. 
3.  We added a map legend to allow for reverse identification of senators by the state they serve. 
4.  A short blurb explaining the purpose of the visualization

## Development Process

We met a total of three times. The first meeting was for three hours, the second was for two and a half hours and the third was for one hour. We worked together on the design, Cynthia found and cleaned the data and translated it from csv to json, Zeno took the lead on writing the code and Cynthia built the storyboard. Individually, Zeno spent roughly six hours working on this assignment outside of our meetings and Cynthia spent about eight hours outside of meetings.
